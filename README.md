# Django Greeting Web App

This project is a simple web application built using the Django framework. The application allows users to enter their name and favorite color through a form. After submitting the form, the app performs input validation and dynamically generates a response page that displays a personalized greeting and changes the page styling based on the user's input. This project demonstrates how web frameworks process requests, validate user input, and generate dynamic HTML content.

3. Navigate to the project directory and start the server (python manage.py runserver).
4. Open a browser and go to (http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

Instructions for using the software:
